# Specification Quality Checklist: Risk Dataset Construction

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- MVP_CONTEXT.md Section 2.4 and Section 5 Phase 8 gave a complete basis, including the explicit requirement (echoed in constitution Principle II) that the label derivation be written down and justified. The exact formula is deliberately left to the plan phase, mirroring how Section 3.3 treats Severity's formula (configurable weights, not fixed values).
- All checklist items pass on first validation pass.
